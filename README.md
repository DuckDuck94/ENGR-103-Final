# ENGR-103-Final: Clicky Lights
## Author
Alexa Baruela

## Game Description and Objectives
This game is similar to simon says or bop it, as it uses light and sound which the player must mimic in order to advance to the next level.  There are 10 possible levels to go through.  Every three levels, the light pattern speed increases.

Inputs: Right button, Left button, Switch
Outputs: Lights, Sound, Serial Monitor

## How to Play 
Remember the pattern presented through light and sound, and press the corresponding button to the pattern.  You must remember the pattern correctly in order to pass to the next level!  If a wrong button is pressed, you will have three chances to repeat the level.  If you fail three times, the game will turn off.  

### Important Notes
- You can only start pressing buttons when two quick noises emit from the board (to ensure that your input is correctly taken).
- To help with the delay time, the Serial Monitor displays when the button should be pressed and when that time frame has passed.

I hope you enjoy my game!! <333
